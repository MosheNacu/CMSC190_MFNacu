Abstractâ€”Pathfinder is a wearable computer vision device that
aims to assist in the mobility of the visually impaired. The Shi-
Tomasi Algorithm was applied to detect the feature points and the
obstacles along the path. The software is installed on a Raspberry
Pi. The input is a live video feed captured by the Raspberry Pi
Camera. The device gives directions to the user using sounds.
Nine users participated in testing the device and they agreed
that the device was successful in redirecting them to avoid the
obstacles along the path that they were traversing.
